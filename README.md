# HTML5 Practical (No JS, No Forms)

This site demonstrates modern HTML5 semantics, media, captions, tables, and accessible micro-elements.

- **index.html** — Semantic structure, skip link, headings, quotes, time, abbr, code/kbd/samp.
- **about.html** — Sections, lists, definition lists, internal links.
- **media.html** — `<picture>` responsive image, audio, video with VTT captions.
- **extras.html** — Tables (caption/thead/tbody/tfoot), `<details>`, `<dialog open>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`.
